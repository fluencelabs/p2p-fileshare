# P2P Filesharing on Fluence FaaS

Demo of file sharing app done with p2p FaaS and IPFS. IPFS is orchestrated via functions called by clients, so no file transmission happens on the FaaS side. 

## What's happening?
One client can advertize a file on the Fluence network, so another client can download it. To advertize a file with hash `QmFile` , client announces to network that function `IPFS_QmFile` is now available. To download a file, another client calls that function, and receives address of an IPFS node as a result, it can then download file from that IPFS node.

And that's basically what's conceptually happening. Under the hood, there's a DHT network, function routing (i.e, how to find the first client), and so on. What's interesting about that is there's nothing hard-coded, everything is just a function call.

Clearly, first client (let's call it "provider client") wants to share file with someone. It's a lazy client, and it's plan is simple: *if someone asks me a file, I'll upload it to some storage, and give back an address of that storage*. Since IPFS is awesome, we'll use it for file sharing and storage. Note that provider client doesn't transmit file directly, it barely uploads it to some IPFS node, and returns address of that node. Laazy. 

So, here are the steps:
0. Announced function `IPFS_QmFile` to the network (it's not discoverable through DHT)
*Then, someone called that function, asking for a file*
1. Gosh, need to find where to upload the file: call `IPFS_multiaddr` function
2. Received `/dns4/ipfs2.fluence.one/https/443` as a result
3. Need to upload that file: well, uploads it
4. Send back IPFS node address: `/dns4/ipfs2.fluence.one/https/443`

And that's it. No complex connections, traffic management, and whatnot. Everything is handled by awesome IPFS node, functions just asking node to help. Consumer client (the one who asked the file in the first place) is free to do what it wants with that node address, maybe forward it to a more complex workflow?

## The code
There's a JS, and the Elm parts of code. JS is where all business logic, function calling and gears turning happens, Elm is where all the UI stuff is defined. 

To understand the code, it's better to start with [ports.js](src/ports.js), that's the boundary between business logic and UI, it should be pretty self-explanatory. Or will be that one day üôè.

## Running it
```
cd p2p-filesharing
npm i
npm run start
```

## Elm
Did I say that the Elm is awesome? No?! Well, let me fix that: *it is awesome.* And being awesome, Elm gives you this little blue icon in the right bottom corner, and it's a... *Time Machine*. For real. You can use it to go back and forth in application lifecycle, and see what was happening, why, see all the UI changes that usually happen in a blink of an eye. Have fun!
